# Comprehensive Retirement Simulator

This is a personal project for me to practice:
- Simulation (Monte-Carlo methods)
- Web Development

but also build a useful tool. 


# TODO: 
- Add input based on asset allocation and display:
    - Asset allocation
    - assumed mean, variance, and distribution
